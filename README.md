## Description 
### Goal 

Develop an adaptive indexing approach that leverages the matrix profile on unevenly sampled, multivariate time series, using variable window lengths tailored to local sampling density and signal behavior.

#### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Handle irregular sampling via:
    - Interpolation (linear, spline, etc.).
    - Time-aware distance functions (Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED) (https://github.com/pfmarteau/TWED) or Soft-DTW (https://github.com/mblondel/soft-dtw)).
- Normalize per channel (z-score or min-max).

#### 2. Adaptive Window Strategy

- Investigate window sizing policies:

    - Signal-based: entropy, variance, or gradient magnitude.
    - Time-based: inter-sample time gap threshold.
- Implement a method to dynamically define windows over each segment of data per channel or jointly.

#### 3. Matrix Profile Integration

- Use stumpy or matrixprofile library to compute:

    - Matrix profiles within each window.
    - Multivariate extensions like mSTAMP or mSTOMP for multidimensional series.
- Adapt the algorithm to use non-uniform windows (a key novelty here).

#### 4. Indexing and Retrieval
- Store subsequence embeddings (from matrix profile distances or motifs) in a fast index (e.g. FAISS [https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss]).
- Allow fast retrieval of nearest neighbors or anomalies based on profile values.
#### 5. Anomaly Detection
- Anomalies = subsequences with high profile values (i.e., no close neighbor).
- Score and rank anomalies across windows and channels.
 - (Optional) Fuse anomalies across variables using joint profile metrics.

### Evaluation

- Datasets:
    - Numenta NAB [irregular IoT-style data] (https://github.com/numenta/NAB)
    - Custom data of the Signal Processing Lab
- Metrics:
    - Anomaly detection (precision, recall, F1, AUC)
    - Index/query latency
    - Profile computation time vs. standard mSTAMP
    - Robustness to sampling irregularity and noise
### Deliverables

- A modular Python package with:
    - Preprocessing pipeline
    - Adaptive windowing
    - Matrix profile computation (single and multivariate)
    - Index-based anomaly scoring
- Jupyter notebooks with reproducible experiments
- Benchmark results and short technical report or blog

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

### Matrix Profile (Motif & Anomaly Discovery)

- **STUMPY**: Core library for efficient matrix profile computation on univariate and multivariate time series (`aamp`, `mammp`).
- **matrixprofile (UCR)**: Alternative implementation from academia.
- Used to detect:
  - **Motifs** (frequent repeated patterns)
  - **Discords** (outliers or rare patterns)
  - **Segment boundaries**
- Supports adaptive and irregular windowing strategies via custom wrapping.

### Similarity Measures & Loss Functions

#### DTW-Based Methods

- **DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)**: Classic alignment method to measure similarity between time series with temporal misalignments.
- **Soft-DTW**: Differentiable DTW variant usable as a loss function in learning frameworks.

#### Complexity Correction

- **CID (Complexity-Invariant Distance)**: Normalization term applied to any distance (DTW, Euclidean, etc.) that penalizes shape complexity differences.
- Enhances robustness when comparing complex vs. smooth patterns.

### Indexing, Embedding & Retrieval

#### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

- High-performance library for **fast nearest-neighbor vector search**.
- Used in this project to:
  - **Index and compress vector representations** of discovered or reference-based motifs.
  - **Query similarity or anomaly** without needing raw signal or reference CSVs.
  - Enable **real-time recognition and anomaly detection** based on learned memory.

### Clustering & Anomaly Segmentation (Optional)

- Embeddings can be **clustered** (e.g., KMeans, HDBSCAN) to group similar patterns or discover new ones.
- FAISS query results with **high distances** or **out-of-cluster** embeddings are treated as anomalies.
- Adaptive thresholds can be tuned per motif group or learned dynamically.

### Pipeline Integration

- Supports both **reference-free discovery** (pure Matrix Profile) and **reference-driven recognition** (FAISS + DTW/CID).
- Includes:
  - Preprocessing of irregular multivariate data.
  - Adaptive window sizing.
  - Matrix profile generation.
  - Embedding and FAISS indexing.
  - Real-time motif classification and anomaly detection.
